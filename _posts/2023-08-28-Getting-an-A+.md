Talking to non-departmental IT support professionals in Sharjah, the A+ isn't the clincher for all their duties, but it is a foundation if nothing else. They recommended I get more comfortable with Windows and Windows server.

The CompTIA A+ certification has a lot of material for practice, and there is a wonderful ~10 hr course on YouTube by the channel Professor Messer, who offers additional materials and the like on his site.

For my part, I jotted notes - splitting them where possible. There are a lot of names - and x10 as many acronyms.

I wrote the notes on the terminal with Neovim, and saved them on separate csv files. I put them all in one deck, but tagged each file's import with its appropriate tag.

Furthermore, I will also update the deck with media files - even though I mostly avoid them. 

Remembering what a molex connector or any other interface/connector/header looks like would be helpful.

Now it's time to learn something else, while reviewing the cards as I forget - Spaced Repetition has rarely let me down with school and university after all.

What's next for my extra-curriculars is a deeper dive into Windows for client and server systems. 

Professor Messer has a YouTube playlist for it of the same time commitment. Though I suppose too I should supplement my learning with some written material.
