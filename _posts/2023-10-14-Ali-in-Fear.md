    The stars were all Ali could focus on during the blackout. How they were so set against the almost pitch black surface, they looked like holes or openings from a brighter world. He imagined them twinkling and beaming as the nursery rhyme goes because he knew what his mind would end up doing as soon as he gave it a chance.

<p>
    He was left alone in a dark and silent room. The only source of light being the faint, but bright beacons that he focused on, as even the moon left him or so he thought. He was grabbing first his forearm, then his shoulder, and finally climbed up and gathered a handful of his right cheek and left ear. He wanted to remind himself that he was both with himself, by touching his body; and safe with others such as the stars, by gazing at the cosmos. All the while breathing as if had just ran a hundred and one metres.

    The pitiful state he was in lasted maybe 5 minutes or 5 seconds. Time had become not even a secondary issue for our hero for lack of a better word. Or perhaps he's guilty of the charge? Fighting and keeping at bay, one's inner demons is as close to such a battle as most of us would ever have, even if most of us would not have this a hard time of it. And what of it, demons were never real in the first place, they are all constructs of our imagination and memory based on stories rather than accounting.

    These were the inner monologues of Ali between breaths of 'It will pass' and 'I will get through this,' after he lost interest in the specks of glorified dust. He then ventured into a favoured pastime of his, which was slightly playful self-deprecation. Eventually, after thinking about a time in which he would think back on this time, he realised how silly all of this was and stopped it all to laugh. A laugh that turned forced and desperate as he returned to touching himself and avoiding gazing long into the open door that led to the hallway.

    Then, the sounds started, though slowly at first, but there was no way of overturning pandora's paranoia.
    </p>
<p>
    Both of his brothers were cheerfully yelling with their footsteps echoing. Then his parents were, in the same mood, attempting a ceasefire. Then he heard his name from everyplace that happened to be behind him, or otherwise out of view. Then there was a grateful lull where his thoughts were as non-existent as the danger to his life.
    </p>
<p>
    Then the fear kicked in: fear of a monster that *could* come up. Fear of sudden screams from unblinking faces that led to chase sequences *could* happen. The poor and obvious irreality of it all failed to act as reinforcements into Ali's mind who was rational no longer. He had accepted the fact of his mortality, but that was not what feared him. What did was the *potential* for frights, the *potential* for an illicit encounter. If the fear juices had not drowned half his brain, boredom would have saved him from this state.

<p>
    All he needed to do was to do, though not despite but to spite his emotions. Something, anything could be the action, but all he needed to do was take it and train his brain to understand the actual danger to him and his person. He was gearing up for it, clutching his fists and eyelids, and controlling his breathing. He raised himself, but before he could put a foot in for walking, he heard the fan rev up, then saw the room light up.
    </p>
<p>
    Though forgetting he would have to do this all over again soon enough, he felt such relief, and then went back clicking keys on his computer as if none of it ever happened.

This story was something I wrote a long time ago. I think it has some potential, but I was neither disabused of big emotions coming from big words nor that the quantity of words does not equal wit.

Plus, it could have benefitted from focus, a stark difference in writing style or paragraph content - and fewer mentions of fear directly.

I could perhaps have experimented with slow descriptions of what was seen. A sudden transition from regular beds and cupboards to the abyss staring back would have been an achievement to test my writing capabilities.
